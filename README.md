# Elder Fall Detection

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a real-time fall detection system using a webcam and computer vision techniques. The system detects humans in the camera frame, tracks their movements, and identifies potential falls. It uses a pre-trained human detection model (HOG descriptor) and draws stick figures around detected humans to visualize the detection. The system also includes a simple fall detection algorithm based on changes in aspect ratios and movement patterns.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to create an automated system that can detect falls in real-time, providing a potential safety mechanism for elderly individuals.

## üîë Key Features

- üé• Real-time human detection using a webcam
- üïµÔ∏è Drawing stick figures around detected humans
- üõ†Ô∏è Simple fall detection algorithm based on aspect ratio and movement analysis
- üö® Displaying alerts when a fall is detected

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware:
- Webcam

### Software:
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `src`: Contains the source code for the project
- `models`: Pre-trained models and related files
- `docs`: Project documentation and related materials

## üéõÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/elder-fall-detection.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
 Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
3. **Run the Application**

Execute the main script to start the fall detection system:

   ```bash
   python src/fall_detection.py
```

## üì∏ Sample Usage
**Detecting Falls**
Run the application, and it will start the webcam feed. The system will detect humans in the frame, draw stick figures around them, and display an alert if a fall is detected.

## Dependencies
